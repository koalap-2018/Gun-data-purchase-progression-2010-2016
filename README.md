# Investigating the gun-data and census-datasets

Chose a Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn
Go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question, data cleaning, exploratory analysis, plotting
and finishing by sharing conclussions about the data set.

For this project I used the data from FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The NICS is used by to
determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives. This data is supplemented with census data. 

Here I attempt to asnwer following quetions:
What census data is most associated with high gun per capita?
Which states have had the highest growth in gun registrations?
What is the overall trend of gun purchases?
